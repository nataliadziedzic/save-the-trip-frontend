## Description

> Frontend for application where you can plan your trips. It allows you to add a new trip by entering its title, description and date of departure. In the next steps, you can select documents that you will need during your jurney, create a shopping list for items that you would like to purchase before leaving or add a photo that will distinguish this trip from the others. You can edit or delete all of this later as needed.

## Usage

You can create a new account or log in to a sample account by providing: <br/>
email: sample@account.com <br/>
password: Password123

## Motivation

As I was planning the trip myself, I noticed that I have to remember about many things, especially in the era of a pandemic. There were a lot of documents that I needed to set off and instead of writing on paper or looking for an application that would allow me to keep everything in one place, I decided to use this opportunity to write my own app. Thanks to this, I was able to broaden my knowledge about the basic issues of backend technologies, try Redux Toolkit and get used to Typescript a bit more.
